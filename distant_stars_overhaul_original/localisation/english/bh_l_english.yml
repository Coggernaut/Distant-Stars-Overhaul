The L-Species native to the [From.GetName] system have achieved a tentative mastery of local planet. Scientists have observed a proto-society amongst the natives with use of primitive social behaviors.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] wants to conduct research on this Pre-Sapient L-Species. They propose we monitor their societal and biological development closely, and maybe even help them along if possible. The L-Cluster has given us many questions, and the origin of these L-Species seem increasingly unnatural."

Scientists where concerned that organic genetic theory wouldnt apply to possibly snytheticly constructed DNA. Though after many trials genetic splicing was succesful and the synthetic organisms where reacting positively to our mutagen.

Scans reveal planets with near-perfect conditions for life that have are now being refered to as §YL-Gaia Worlds§!. This is due to their near perfect habitable conditions for life. Paradoxically the system has an unaturally high amount of planets that have been shattered beyond recognition.\n\nOur lead scientist theorizes the L-Cluster may be plagued by rogue planets, but this theory is still debated. The scientific community is eager to explore the L-Cluster and learn more about these L-Species. Though this still leaves the question of who or what built the L-Gates in the first place. The leading theory is the L-Gates where constructed as a barrier to keep the L-Species isolated. Because of this theory, our military advisors have advised using caution while exploring the L-Cluster."
