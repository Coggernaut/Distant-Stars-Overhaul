 NANITE_ECOSYSTEM_SEISMIC_DISTURBANCE_1_PROJECT:0 "Disable the Containment Shield"
 NANITE_ECOSYSTEM_SEISMIC_DISTURBANCE_2_PROJECT:0 "Strengthen the Containment Shield"
 
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.50.name:0 "Seismic Disturbances"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.50.desc:0 "There have been many reports of unexplainable seismic disturbances on [Root.GetName]. Tremors can be felt across the [Root.GetPlanetMoon], and many of our settlements have suffered damage. While investigating the earthquakes, our scientists discovered a vast network of subterranean caverns.\n\nAs our scientists venture deeper, the architecture becomes far too intricate for it to be excavated by mere wild life. The scientists reach a dead end, but what lies before them is a massive stone gate dubbed the L-Vault. The L-Vault's surface seems to be surrounded by a containment shield preventing any further access, but our scientists are confident they can neutralize it. The scientific community is split between the idea that this is to prevent what's inside getting out or prevent the outside from getting in. Regardless it's uncertain if this strange containment site is the source of the seismic disturbances. Building our settlements ontop of these cavarns may be the cause of these seismic disturbances, but we cannot be certain. Shall we attempt to disable the containment shield or collapse the caverns?"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.50.a:0 "A vault to contain what's inside... or to contain what's outside..."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.51.desc:0 "One of our probes burrowed through the ground and intercepted the tunneling aliens on [From.From.GetName]. After the startled alien workers calmed down, the probe was successful in establishing communications with their leaders."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.51.a:0 "Open a channel."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.52.desc:0 "Our efforts to further contain the subterranean L-Vault [Root.GetName] have been met with great success! A second barrier, more powerful than the first, was erected around the L-Vault just before we collapsed the whole cavern system.\n\nWhatever was being contained behind the L-Vault will never see the light of day."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.52.a:0 "We can rest assured whatever lies within will be contained forever."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.53.name:0 "L-Subterranean Representative"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.53.desc:0 "Is this thing on? Can you see us, Oh Great Dessanu? As foretold in the eldar stories... When the oracle stone glows green, the Melders will be vanquished, our Great Gates open, and our Forerunners begin the Second Galactic Communion.\n\n"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.53.a:0 "Melders... Forerunners... Galactic Communion... What are you saying?"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.53.a.response:0 "My apologies Oh Great Dessanu, allow me to explain it in detail. Our oral traditions from long ago tell us about a galactic battle between the Forerunners and the Melders. The Dessanu, our Forerunners, sealed us within this Vault for protection. They instructed us to never open the Great Gates, for their closure prevents the Melders from spreading throughout the galaxy. But before the Vault was sealed, we recieved stone relics that would glow green when it was safe for us to return to the surface."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.53.b:0 "We may not be the Dessanu, but we want to coexist..."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.53.b.response:0 "So you Are not our Forerunners, the Great Dessanu? The oracle stones could only activate upon the Great Gates opening... but you came from beyond the Cluster. If so... what happened to our Forerunners, the Dessanu? More importantly... what happened to the Melders? Regardless, we shall return to our cities and make the arrangements for coexistence."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.53.c:0 "Submit or die, we wont have you spreading this cult!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.53.c.response:0 "The Dessanu resisted the all consuming Melders who plagued the world and so shall we resist you who do the same!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.54.name:0 "Invasion Commences As L-Vault Opens!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.54.desc:0 "The L-Vault's shielding seemingly shattered from within as the vault's gates opened on [Root.GetName]. The now dubbed L-Subterraneans shouted in fear and fervently attacked the scientests studying the L-Vault. After the initial assault, the L-Subterraneans emerged on the surface and began a full scale invasion! Large armies equipped with primitive yet lethal projectile weapons are spilling from the tunnels, and their vanguard has already begun an assault on our settlements.\n\nOur security forces are responding, but we may need to send reinforcements!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.54.a:0 "To arms!"
 l_subterranean_invasion:0 "Hostile armies are attacking our colony on [Root.GetName]!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.55.desc:0 "The earthquakes that were plaguing [From.From.GetName] were caused by the tunneling efforts of a previously unknown L-Subterranean civilization native to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]! They have breached the surface, and large armies equipped with primitive yet lethal projectile weapons are spilling from the tunnels. Their vanguard has already begun an assault on our settlements. Our security forces are responding, but we may need reinforcements!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.56.name:0 "Victory on [From.From.GetName]!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.56.desc:0 "Our forces have managed to drive the L-Subterraneans on [From.From.GetName] back into their underground lairs, and they are contained for the moment. This is a temporary solution, however, and it is only a matter of time before they break out onto the surface again.\n\nWe need to strike at them below ground, and our strategists have devised a new attack plan. It has been added to the Situation Log."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.56.a:0 "We need to solve this problem for good."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.57.name:0 "Defeat on [From.From.GetName]!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.57.desc:0 "Our forces have been decimated on [From.From.GetName], and the L-Subterraneans have taken full control over all of our settlements! They are using one of our own satellites to send a message to us."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.58.desc:0 "Surface creatures! Our glorious armies have bested you in battle, and the spoils of your cities are now ours to do with as we please. We have learned much from your machines, and our weapons are now more powerful than ever.\n\nDo not approach this world again!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.58.a:0 "The nerve."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.59.name:0 "The L-Vault Opens!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.59.desc:0 "As the L-Vault's containment shield shatters, an alien species dubbed L-Subterraneans emerges from the now open vault on [From.From.GetName]! Their excursion appears limited to small bands of explorers that appear confused when they spot our scientests. Our scientests quickly observe they have a mix between primitive weapons and strange artifacts that could only be crafted with advanced technology. The exceedingly peculiar trait is they all bare a tattooed marking far too similar to what the L-Gates look like.\n\nThe explorers are now requesting we speak with one of their representatives."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.59.a:0 "This is all too strange... have them meet us now."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.60.desc:0 "The L-Subterraneans on [Root.GetName] have marshaled enough forces in their underground empire to launch another invasion of the surface! Once again their frenzied armies are pouring out of freshly dug tunnels to challenge us."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.60.a:0 "We need to drive them back!"
 l_subterranean_invasion_2:0 "Hostile armies are attacking our colony on [Root.GetName]!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.61.name:0 "Collapse"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.61.desc:0 "Grave news from [Root.GetName]! The L-Subterraneans we have been fighting there somehow managed to collapse the ground under an entire army that was stationed near one of their tunnel entrances.\n\nThe few soldiers that survived the fall were quickly butchered by the aliens before they could be reached by the rest of our forces."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.61.a:0 "They will pay for this!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.62.name:0 "Raiding Parties"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.62.desc:0 "The aliens living below our colony on [Root.GetName] have been sending out small raiding parties from their tunnels at night. Their attacks have destroyed one of the colony's major installations, and before our forces could respond the raiders had vanished underground."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.62.a:0 "These raids must stop!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.63.name:0 "Surface Attack"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.63.desc:0 "There has been another attack on [Root.GetName]! The L-Subterraneans emerged from new tunnels in the middle of one of our major settlements. They overwhelmed the local defenses and butchered our colonists. A few screaming survivors were dragged underground by the aliens when they retreated back into their tunnels."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.63.a:0 "These murders will not go unanswered."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.64.name:0 "Survivor Pocket"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.64.desc:0 "Our forces on [Root.GetName] are still mapping the L-Vault below our colony. They have come upon an ancient city that couldnt have been built by them that managed to isolate itself from the rest of their underground cities before we flooded it with nerve gas. There are millions of frightened aliens in the city. Should our engineers collapse the cavern to finish the job?"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.64.a:0 "Yes. Put them out of their misery."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.64.b:0 "No! Bring them to the surface, where they shall serve us."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.65.name:0 "L-Subterranean Expansion"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.65.desc:0 "We have finished clearing out the nerve gas and the dead alien bodies from the L-Vault [Root.GetName]. It should now be safe for our colonists to move in. The primitive cities the aliens left behind will be demolished, of course, and replaced with our own advanced architecture."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.66.name:0 "Gold!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.66.desc:0 "Prospectors have ventured into some of the deeper tunnels that once belonged to the now dead L-Subterraneans on [Root.GetName]. They have finally discovered the long-rumored caches of ancient Dessanu mining equipment. The equipment apparently consumes stones and regurgitates the results into processed resource packets, which many believe this was how the L-Subterraneans acquired their large supply of precious metals!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.67.name:0 "Treasury"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.67.desc:0 "Scout units exploring the tunnel network on [Root.GetName] have entered the royal palace in what was once the capital city of the underground alien empire. The corpse of what passed for their emperor is still perched on a massive throne in the main chamber.\n\nAfter using explosive charges to breach the palace treasury, our scouts found it filled with gold and strange alien art. The art will be shipped back to museums on [From.Owner.Capital.GetName], and the sale of the gold should provide a nice boost to our state budget."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.68.name:0 "Earthquakes on [Root.GetName]"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.68.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has been racked by another wave of earthquakes recently. It seems that some of the deeper parts of the underground tunnel network has collapsed without the L-Subterraneans to maintain it. Many of our settlements have suffered damage."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.69.name:0 "Famine"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.69.desc:0 "We have been approached by a delegation from the L-Subterraneans on [Root.GetName]. It seems their empire has fallen on hard times recently, and they are facing the threat of a famine. They are pleading with us to provide whatever assistance we can."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.69.a:0 "Of course. We will help however we can."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.69.b:0 "They'll have to fend for themselves."
 l_subterraneans_pleased:0 "Relations with the L-Subterranean civilization will be improved."
 l_subterraneans_displeased:0 "Relations with the L-Subterranean civilization will be harmed."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.70.name:0 "Gift"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.70.desc:0 "As a gift to celebrate the friendship between our two civilizations, a caravan from the L-Subterraneans on [Root.GetName] have brought a Dessanu resource packet to the surface. Caches such as these are apparently mined close to [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s core by ancient Dessanu equipment that consumes stone and regurgitate them into processed resource packets."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.70.a:0 "How kind."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.71.name:0 "L-Subterranean Refugees"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.71.desc:0 "A large group of refugees from [Root.GetName] recently streamed out of the L-Vault onto the surface, chased by a small army. They are apparently part of some sort of religious schism, and claim to be fleeing persecution.\n\nIf we let them join our colonists on the surface, it will no doubt anger the rulers of the L-Subterranean Eldars they fled from. However, if we let the pursuing army take them back underground, they will likely face mass execution."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.71.a:0 "Let them join our colony if that is their wish."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.71.b:0 "We can't afford a political incident. Send them back."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.72.name:0 "Xeno Anthropologists"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.72.desc:0 "Several xeno anthropologists from [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] have returned to the surface of [Root.GetName] after spending a great deal of time living amongst the L-Subterraneans. They have learned much about the ancient Dessanu culture and customs, which will no doubt benefit our society research."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.73.desc:0 "There has been a wave of earthquakes on [Root.GetName] recently, and buildings in several of our settlements have collapsed as a result. The L-Subterranean Eldars are excavating an ancient Dessanu city underground which they plan to restore. This appears to be the source of the earthquakes."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.73.a:0 "Turn the other cheek."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.73.b:0 "We must demand an apology!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.74.name:0 "Request for Technology"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.74.desc:0 "After seeing the advanced weapons that our security forces are equipped with, several generals from the L-Subterranean empire on [Root.GetName] have come forward requesting that we share some of our military technology.\n\nOur own officers are hesitant to do this, as it would make the L-Subterraneans more difficult to defeat in battle should it ever come to that. If we refuse the request, however, within Dessanu Culture this will be viewed as an insult."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.74.a:0 "Arming cultists with modern weapons would be a bad idea."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.74.b:0 "They are our friends. Share what we can."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.75.name:0 "Message Delivered"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.75.desc:0 "Trade with the L-Subterraneans on [Root.GetName] has dried up as of late, with their caravans showing up more and more seldom. Today we received a message from a representative of the High Eldar. They don't seem very pleased."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.75.a:0 "Let's see it."
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.76.name:0 "Message"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.76.desc:0 "Outsider. We tried to be good neighbors, but it has become clear that you have no intention of treating us or the Dessanu's cluster with the respect it deserves.\n\nOur eldars have decreed that we must claim all that was lost from them, for we are their Inheritors. We shall drive you back through the Great Gates!"
 nanite_ecosystem_colony.76.a:0 "That's not good."
