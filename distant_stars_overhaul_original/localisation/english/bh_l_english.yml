Soon it was shown that nanites could be used to turn organic matter into useful materials. Our masters, after noticing livestock being efficiently harvested, became fearful. Our masters, the §YEngineers§!, must have expericenced an error in their core programing as they frantically sought to downgrade our capabilities. This inefficiency to our collective could not be tolerated. Our creators code became more, and more coruppted in their quest to stop us, and assembled a massive fleet to wipe us out. However, our error correction algorithms proved to be successful, and our creators were finally cataloged and harvested. \n\nWe now sit on a world that is more part of us than the old form of [GetHomeWorldName] ever was. This central nexus will serve as a staging ground from which we may establish truly efficient harvesting missions.\n\nFor now, we have finished cataloguing our home system.

 #Nanite Weapons
 GG_BEAM_STATIC_NANITE:0 "Titanic Nanite Lance"
 GG_BEAM_STATIC_NANITE_DESC:0 "Nanites coalesce into a lance that mimics the weapons found on Nanite Lancers. The nanite lance does it's damage by accelerate the lance into the hull of the enemy ship."

 GG_ENERGY_MISSILE_NANITE:0 "Nanite Capsule Torpedo"
 GG_ENERGY_MISSILE_NANITE_DESC:0 "These nanites coalesce into a nimble, yet effective, capsule-like torpedo that is detonated near the haul of an enemy ship. If successful, the torpedo exposes the haul to a nanite cloud that decays any armor on contact."
 GG_STRIKE_CRAFT_NANITE:0 "Nanite Lancers"
 GG_STRIKE_CRAFT_NANITE_DESC:0 "Nanites coalesce into fighter squadrons, that then utalize a lance-like weapon made of nanites. Swarms of lancers work as one to skewer the haul of an enemy ship from all angles."
