 nanite_ecosystem_uplift.6080.desc:0 "Numerous rapidly evolving L-Species have been observed within the L-Cluster, But Scientists aboard the [Root.GetName] where not expecting this finding. The L-Species native to the [From.GetName] system have achieved a tentative mastery of local environment. Scientists have observed a proto-society amongst the natives with use of primitive social behaviors.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] wants to conduct research on this Pre-Sapient L-Species. They propose we monitor their societal and biological development closely, and maybe even help them along if possible. The L-Cluster has given us many questions, and the origin of these L-Species seem increasingly unnatural."

Scientists where concerned that organic genetic theory wouldn't apply to syntheticly constructed DNA. Though after many trials genetic splicing was successful and the synthetic organisms where reacting positively to our mutagen. It was after uplifting them our scientist's understood the biology of the L-Species."

These planets are now being referred to as §YL-Gaia Worlds§!. Paradoxically the system has an unnaturally high amount of planets that have been shattered beyond recognition.\n\nOur lead scientist theorizes the L-Cluster may be plagued by rogue planets, but this theory is still debated. The scientific community is eager to explore the L-Cluster and learn more about these L-Species. Though this still leaves the question of who or what built the L-Gates in the first place."
