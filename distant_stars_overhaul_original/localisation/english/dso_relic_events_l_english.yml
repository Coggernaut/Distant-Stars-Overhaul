This site will now not only add to the colony's production output, but also a historic site harnessing the unity of our species."

These xenophobic extremists called themselves the §H[dso_story_dessanu_cult_schism.GetName]§!, and have been responsible for sabotaging xeno-communication efforts and acts of terror over the years.\n\nAlthough they have kept a low profile in modern times, we recently learned that many of their agents have infiltrated our military. These renegades have secretly been diverting resources to the construction of a small fleet of starships at a hidden facility on [Root.Capital.GetName]!

However, several of the starships they built in secret remain unaccounted for and the upper echelons of the cult's leadership have vanished.
